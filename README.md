## Overview

A RESTful API is a web service architecture that adheres to
specific constraints:

- statelessness,
- uniform interface,
- client-server separation

Typically using HTTP methods like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`.
It uses standard web protocols to enable interoperability
between distributed systems.

## Features

### Request types

- HTTP RESTful (1.0, 1.1, 2, 3)
- GraphQL (queries, mutations)
- OpenAPI (spec load, explorer UI tree, Try it out overrides, LSP completions, `$ref` bundling, Swagger 2.0)
- gRPC
- WebSockets

### Variables

- Host Environment
- Document variables
- Request scoped variables
- `http-client.env` files
- Built-in support for [withsecrets](https://withsecrets.com) (`ws`; legacy `kuba` alias still works)

### Scripting

Supports JavaScript, Lua, and TypeScript for:

- Pre-request
- Post-request
- Conditional
- Inline
- External

### Authentication

- Basic
- Bearer
- OAuth 2.0

### Automation and testing

Assertions, automated testing and reporting
is compatible with the IntelliJ HTTP Client:

## Usage

### Example .http files

See the [http-example-files][http-example-files]
directory for example .http files.

### Example integrations

See the [examples][examples]
directory for integration examples.

### curl binary

Resolution order: `KULALA_CURL_PATH` (if set),
then a pinned copy under the user cache (for example on Linux: `~/.local/share/kulala-core/cache/curl/<platform>-<arch>/curl`),
then **curl** on your `PATH`,
then a one-time download of a pinned static build (SHA-256 verified) into that cache.
You can override the data or cache root with `KULALA_CORE_DATA_DIR` / `KULALA_CORE_CACHE_DIR`.

- **Published library** (`dist/`): the npm build sets `__KULALA_EMBED_CURL__=false`, so the package does **not** embed curl from the machine that ran `npm publish`.
- **`bun build --compile`**: run `packages/core/scripts/generate-vendored-curl.ts` (optionally with `--target=bun-…` for cross-compiles) so the matching curl is present in the cache and embedded for that build, then compile with `--define __KULALA_EMBED_CURL__=true` and `--compile-autoload-package-json` (needed so request scripts can `require()` packages from the project's `node_modules`).
